## Overview

Helios is an open-source platform designed to simplify the visualization and analysis of real-time event streams by exposing data for SQL querying. Our [automated deployment process](https://github.com/helios-pipeline/deploy) and intuitive interface allow teams to query and gain insights from their existing event streams.

To learn more about the Helios platform, including instructions on how to get started, visit our [website](https://helios.github.io/).
